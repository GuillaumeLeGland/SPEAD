# SPEAD
Code and data for the phytoplankton community model SPEAD (Simulating Plankton Evolution with Adaptive Dynamics)

The temporary version currently available (SPEAD1.0_temp) is the version used to write the article submitted to Geoscientific Model Development by Guillaume Le Gland, Sergio M. Vallina, S. Lan Smith and Pedro Cermeno in early September 2020. It is built in MATLAB R2010b.
Its main module is jamstecrest_gausssecomodel1D.m. The model parameters can be modified in jamstecrest_gaussecomodel1D_keys and jamstecrest_gaussecomodel1D_parameters. 

A more user-friendly version (SPEAD1.0) able to compute all the quantities and plot all the figures mentioned in the article will be uploaded by the end of September. For this definitive version, compatibility with GNU Octave and with several operation systems will be checked.

Please contact me (legland@icm.csic.es) if you cannot download, run or understand the model.
